# Using Quarto for presentations

## Quarto

-   The presentation is created using the Quarto CLI

-   `##` sets the start of a new slide

## Layouts

You can use plain text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
-   or bullet points[^1]
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
or in two columns
:::
:::::

[^1]: And add footnotes

-   like

-   this

## Code
```{r}
#| label: build model
#| include: false
#| echo: false
# Load data here

table(exped$SUCCESS1, useNA = "ifany")
exped2 <- exped %>%
  mutate(
    # Convert summit success to binary numeric (adjust if needed)
    success = ifelse(SUCCESS1 %in% c("Y", "Yes", "yes"), 1,
                     ifelse(SUCCESS1 %in% c("N", "No", "no"), 0, as.numeric(SUCCESS1))),
    peak = as.factor(PEAKID),
    team_size = as.numeric(TOTMEMBERS),
    oxygen = ifelse(O2USED %in% c("Y", "Yes", "yes"), 1,
                    ifelse(O2USED %in% c("N", "No", "no"), 0, as.numeric(O2USED))),
    season = as.factor(SEASON)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(success), !is.na(team_size), !is.na(oxygen)) # Remove rows with missing values

model <- glm(
  success ~ peak + team_size + oxygen + season + YEAR,
  data = exped2,
  family = "binomial"
)
summary(model)

```



## Plots

```{r}
exped2 %>%
  group_by(team_size) %>%
  summarize(success_rate = mean(success), n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = team_size, y = success_rate)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "Success Rate by Team Size", x = "Team Size", y = "Success Rate")
```

## Plot and text

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Some text

-   goes here
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r, warning=FALSE, fig.width=5.5}
penguins |>
  ggplot(aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = species, color = species)) +
  geom_boxplot(linewidth = 0.75,
               outlier.size = 2.5) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 15) +
  theme(legend.key.size = unit(0.8, "cm"))
```

## Tables

If you want to generate a table, make sure it is in the HTML format (instead of Markdown or other formats), e.g.,

```{r}
penguins |> 
  head() |>
  kableExtra::kable() |>
  kableExtra::kable_styling()
```

## Images

## Math Expressions {.smaller}

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g.Â \$\\alpha+\\beta\$ renders $\alpha + \beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```         
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$
\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i
$$

Limitations:

1.  The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

2.  There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

# Wrap up

## Feeling adventurous?

-   You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content of your presentation.

-   But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. Some solutions for this can be found at https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs.
