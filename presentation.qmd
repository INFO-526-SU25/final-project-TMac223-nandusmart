## Our Dataset

-   Himalayan Database - Created to continue the legacy of Elizabeth Hawley, a journalist who spent decades documenting Himalayan expeditions.

-   Dataset - [**TidyTuesday GitHub repository**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-01-21)Â and has been amended to the years 2020 - 2024 to manage file size.

-   There are 2 main datasets :

    -   **exped_tidy** - Contains details of expeditions

    -   **peaks_tidy** - Includes data about the Himalayan Peaks

### Question 1

**What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?**

Analyze expedition outcomes using both expedition and peak variables. "Success" will be defined based on the \`TERMREASON_FACTOR\`, with specific values representing a successful summit (e.g., "Success (main peak)", "Success (claimed)").

### Approach

-   Get Data from the CSV files

```{r}
#| label: load-data
#| include: false
# Load data here

exped <- read_csv("data/exped_tidy.csv")
colnames(exped)
head(exped)

table(exped$SUCCESS1, useNA = "ifany")

```

-   Build Model
```{r}
#| label: build model
#| code-fold: true
# Load data here

table(exped$SUCCESS1, useNA = "ifany")
exped2 <- exped %>%
  mutate(
    # Convert summit success to binary numeric (adjust if needed)
    success = ifelse(SUCCESS1 %in% c("Y", "Yes", "yes"), 1,
                     ifelse(SUCCESS1 %in% c("N", "No", "no"), 0, as.numeric(SUCCESS1))),
    peak = as.factor(PEAKID),
    team_size = as.numeric(TOTMEMBERS),
    oxygen = ifelse(O2USED %in% c("Y", "Yes", "yes"), 1,
                    ifelse(O2USED %in% c("N", "No", "no"), 0, as.numeric(O2USED))),
    season = as.factor(SEASON)
  ) %>%
  filter(!is.na(success), !is.na(team_size), !is.na(oxygen)) # Remove rows with missing values

model <- glm(
  success ~ peak + team_size + oxygen + season + YEAR,
  data = exped2,
  family = "binomial"
)


```

-   1. Success rate By Year
```{r}
exped2 %>%
  group_by(team_size) %>%
  summarize(success_rate = mean(success), n = n()) %>%
  filter(n > 3) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = team_size, y = success_rate)) +
    geom_line() +
    labs(title = "Success Rate by Team Size", x = "Team Size", y = "Success Rate")
```
