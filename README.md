Final Project repo for INFO 526 - Summer 2025.

### **Overview**

This project explores what factors influence both **summit success** and **safety outcomes** in high-altitude Himalayan expeditions. Drawing from the **Himalayan Database** (2020–2024 subset), the analysis uses both descriptive and inferential methods to identify patterns in team composition, geography, commercial structure, and funding.

There are two guiding questions:

1.  **What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?**

2.  **Does expedition funding affect safety outcomes?**
