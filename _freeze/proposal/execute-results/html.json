A brief description of your dataset including its provenance, dimensions, etc. as well as the reason why you chose this dataset.\n\nThe Himalayan Database was created to continue the legacy of Elizabeth Hawley, a journalist who spent decades documenting Himalayan expeditions. This procured version is provided on [**TidyTuesday GitHub repository**](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main/data/2025/2025-01-21) and has been amended to the years 2020 - 2024 to manage file size.\n\nThere are two main datasets included: `exped_tidy`, which contains details of expeditions. And `peaks_tidy`, which includes data about the Himalayan Peaks.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load TidyTuesday data inline\ntuesdata <- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(2025, week = 3)\nexped_tidy <- tuesdata$exped_tidy\npeaks_tidy <- tuesdata$peaks_tidy\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Dimensions of each tibble\ndim(exped_tidy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 882  69\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndim(peaks_tidy)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 480  29\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Variables from `exped_tidy`\n\n| Variable | Description | Your Notes |\n|----|----|----|\n| `TERMREASON_FACTOR` | Reason the expedition ended | Outcome variable (success/failure) Also includes injury |\n| `SEASON_FACTOR` | Season of the expedition | Obviously winter is more hazardous |\n| `O2USED` | Whether supplemental oxygen was used | None |\n| `MEMBERS` | Number of expedition team members | Team size |\n| `HIRDMEMB` | Number of hired staff | None |\n| `COMRTE` | Indicates if expedition was commercially organized | Commercial/non-commercial |\n| `YEAR` | Year of expedition 2020–2024 | Dates 2020–2024 |\n| `DEATHS` | Number of deaths during expedition | Safety outcome |\n| `FUNDING_TYPE` | Commercial, Private, etc. | Derived variable to filter for funding type Commercial vs Private |\n\n### Variables from `peaks_tidy`\n\n| Variable | Description | Your Notes |\n|----|----|----|\n| `HEIGHTM` | Elevation of the peak in meters | High elevation might drive both risk and cost |\n| `HIMAL_FACTOR` | Name of the mountain | None |\n| `REGION_FACTOR` | Broader geographic region grouping peaks | Geographic variability in danger and cost |\n| `PSTATUS_FACTOR` | Peak status climbed or unclimbed | Less frequently climbed peaks possibly more dangerous |\n\nWe chose this dataset because it provides multiple opportunities to explore the intersection of geography, climate, and human decision-making under extreme conditions. It supports both modeling and visualization of expedition risk, success, and outcomes.\n\n## Questions\n\nThe two questions you want to answer.\n\nQuestion 1. What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?\n\nQuestion 2. Does an expeditions funding affect safety outcomes?\n\n## Analysis plan\n\n-   A plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\n**Question 1: What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?**\n\nWe will analyze expedition outcomes using both expedition and peak variables. \"Success\" will be defined based on the `TERMREASON_FACTOR`, with specific values representing a successful summit (e.g., \"Success (main peak)\", \"Success (claimed)\"). The aim is to model how geography, team size, oxygen use, and other factors relate to the likelihood of success.\n\nWe will filter by success and explore facets of the data. Below is an example of how we might focus our attention on correlated variables.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Select only numeric variables\nexped_numeric <- exped_tidy |> select(where(is.numeric))\n\nggcorr(exped_numeric,\n  label = TRUE,\n  label_alpha = TRUE,\n  label_size = 3,\n  hjust = 1,\n  layout.exp = 1\n) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Correlation Matrix of Expedition Variables\",\n    subtitle = \"numeric variables only*\",\n    caption = \"Source: Himalayan Database (2020–2024)\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](proposal_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=2100}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### Variables involved:\n\nThese are some of the variables that we think might be promising. Note that the correlation matrix above is only numeric and does not include other data types. Neither the list or the correlation plot is all inclusive.\n\n-   From `exped_tidy`:\\\n    `TERMREASON_FACTOR`, `SEASON_FACTOR`, `O2USED`, `MEMBERS`, `HIRDMEMB`, `COMRTE`, `YEAR`\n\n-   From `peaks_tidy`:\\\n    `HEIGHTM`, `HIMAL_FACTOR`, `REGION_FACTOR`, `PSTATUS_FACTOR`\n\n#### Variables to be created:\n\n-   `SUMMIT_SUCCESS` `FUNDING_TYPE` SUMMIT_SUCCESS will be composite variable, possibly grouped by country/team etc.\n\nThis will filter our data for further analysis.\n\n**Question 2. Does an expeditions funding affect safety outcomes?**\n\nThe analysis will be very similar for this question. I suspect there will be some overlap, funding and success rate etc. We will use many of the same variables, but more specifically, `FUNDING_TYPE`.\n\nNOTE: Add \"real world\" examples of expedition success or failure to make analysis relatable.\n",
