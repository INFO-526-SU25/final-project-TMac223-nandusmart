Non-commercial attempts on the same mountains are 5–10 % lower.\n\n-   **`Team-size effects differ by expedition type`**\n\n    **Commercial**: success stays high (75–100 %) across all team sizes, peaking around 20 members.\\\n    **Non-commercial**: a pronounced “U-shape”, very small groups (\\> 80 %) and very large groups (\\~75 %) do better, but mid-sized teams (5–10 climbers) dip down near 50 %\\\n:::\n\n## Question 2\n\nDoes an expedition’s funding (commercial vs non-commercial) affect safety outcomes?\n\nImport data , sort and wrangle\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2 : Motivation & Setup\n\n### Does Funding Type Affect Expedition Safety?\n\n### Purpose\n\nCommercial expeditions are often seen as safer due to better logistics, guides, and resources.\n\nThe following analysis aims to address this assumption by comparing commercial, private, and non-commercial groups.\n\n### How Sponsors Were Categorized\n\nTo determine funding source the data was wrangled and sorted using the \"SPONSOR\" column. This was accomplished by repeatedly editing the sorted list. The sponsor column were nearly all unique. I found an example here:<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59082243/multiple-patterns-for-string-matching-using-case-when>\n\n## Question 2 : summary statistics on safety\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Summarize safety metrics by funding type\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(knitr)\n\nexped_q2 |>\n  group_by(FUNDING_SIMPLIFIED) |>\n  summarise(\n    n_expeditions = n(),\n    n_success = sum(ANY_SUCCESS),\n    n_fatalities = sum(FATALITIES),\n    pct_success = mean(ANY_SUCCESS),\n    pct_fatal = mean(FATALITIES),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |>\n  mutate(\n    pct_success = scales::percent(pct_success, accuracy = 0.1),\n    pct_fatal = scales::percent(pct_fatal, accuracy = 0.1)\n  ) |>\n  kable(\n    caption = \"Expedition Outcomes by Funding Type (2020–2024)\",\n    col.names = c(\n      \"Funding Type\",\n      \"Total Expeditions\",\n      \"Number Successful\",\n      \"Number with Fatalities\",\n      \"Success Rate\",\n      \"Fatality Rate\"\n    ),\n    format = \"html\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n<caption>Expedition Outcomes by Funding Type (2020–2024)</caption>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Funding Type </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Total Expeditions </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Number Successful </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Number with Fatalities </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Success Rate </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Fatality Rate </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Commercial </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 274 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 212 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 8 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 77.4% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 2.9% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Independent/Other </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 517 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 365 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 27 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 70.6% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 5.2% </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Non-commercial </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 91 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 51 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 56.0% </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> 3.3% </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2 : How do Expeditions End?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](test_files/figure-revealjs/How do expeditions end-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe above figure shows that proportionally, accidents are more common with Non-Commercial expeditions.

I wanted to check whether fatality rates have changed over time, and if so, whether some groups are improving faster than others. This smoothed line chart shows the share of expeditions with fatalities by year and funding type. This is overlap with question 1.\n\n## Question 2 : Team Size vs Fatality\n\nNext question: does team size make a difference? You’d think larger teams might be safer due to support and redundancy, but also possibly riskier if they’re less experienced or move slowly. This scatterplot checks whether total team size correlates with success, failure, or fatalities — and whether that varies by funding type.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Team Size and Expedition Outcome by Funding Type](test_files/figure-revealjs/plot-teamsize-vs-outcome-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Question 2 : **Team Size by Funding As Proxy for Safety Resources**\n\nLarge commercial teams often come with more resources: guides, oxygen, fixed ropes, medical support. That could partly explain why they have **lower fatality rates**.\n\nMeanwhile, small non-commercial teams might:\n\n-   Take harder routes (fewer sherpa or porters)\n\n-   Push limits with less redundancy\n\n-   Face more exposure if things go wrong\n\nSo while team size alone doesn’t determine safety, it’s a **proxy** for resourcing — and resourcing links back to safety.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of Team Size by Funding Type](test_files/figure-revealjs/plot-team-size-ridge-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n",
