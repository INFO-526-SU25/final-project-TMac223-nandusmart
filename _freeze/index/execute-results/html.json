Using tidy versions of the Himalayan Database, this project leverages R (tidyverse, tidy models) and Quarto to build an interactive, reproducible data-visualisation narrative around two guiding questions:\n\n-   **What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?**\n\n    -   We knit together expedition, peak, and temporal attributes to explore how season, route choice, peak height, team size, leader nationality, weather windows, and oxygen strategy correlate with summit outcomes. Visual encodings include faceted ridge plots of summit probability across seasons, interactive geographic representations of route popularity versus success.\n\n    -   A multilevel logistic model provides effect-size estimates while accounting for peak-level heterogeneity.\n\n-   **Does an expedition’s funding affect safety outcomes?**\n\n    -   Because direct cost metrics are absent, we construct a funding proxy that blends sponsorship type, total members & hired staff, oxygen usage, and expedition duration.\n\n    -   We then relate this composite to safety indicators like member and staff fatalities, high-altitude illnesses, rescue events via scatter-plot matrices, concentration curves, and Poisson regression. Stratified visualizations highlight differential risk patterns between commercial and self-organised teams.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis project looks at data from many Himalayan mountain climbing trips. We use two main files: one has details about each expedition (called `exped_tidy.csv`), and the other has information about the mountains themselves (`peaks_tidy.csv`). The expedition data covers hundreds of trips over many years. For each trip, we know things like which mountain was climbed, how many people were in the team, if they used oxygen, if it was a commercial (guided) trip, and whether the team reached the summit or not.\n\nThe mountain (peaks) data gives us extra facts, like each mountain’s name, height, and what region it is in. By putting these two datasets together, we can explore how things like team size, the use of oxygen, type of trip, and which mountain was climbed affect the chances of reaching the summit.\n\n## Question 1: What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?\n\n-   Analyze expedition outcomes using both expedition and peak variables. \"Success\" will be defined based on the \\`TERMREASON_FACTOR\\`, with specific values representing a successful summit.\n\n-   Use factors like -- geography, team size, year, and commercial vs non-commercial expeditions\n\n### Introduction\n\nClimbing a Himalayan peak is a big challenge, and not every team that tries will reach the top. Some expeditions succeed, while others turn back before the summit. But what makes the difference? In this project, we want to understand what factors help climbers succeed and what might make them fail.\n\nWe have used following factors:\n\n|

Analysis\n\n::: {style=\"font-size:0.8em; line-height:1.2;\"}\n`Geography, in particular the altitude band of a peak—turns out not to be a simple “the higher you go, the harder it gets” story.`\n\n-   **`Low-altitude peaks (~6800m, e.g. Ama Dablam)`** enjoy very high success rates, thanks to gentler slopes, shorter approaches and straightforward rope-fixed “ladder” routes\n\n-   **`Mid-altitude peaks (~7100–7300m, like Pumori and Baruntse)`** dips to the bottom of the curve,mountains are often more technical, less commercialized, with fewer fixed ropes and smaller teams—so even though they’re “lower,” they prove tougher\n\n-   **`Higher Peaks (8000m+ like Everest)`** enjoys very high success rates, as they benefit from massive infrastructure (high-traffic base camps, helicopter support etc.), which more than offsets the physiological challenge of extreme altitude\n\nOverall, a peak’s infrastructure and traffic are at least as critical to success as its height.\n:::\n\n###

This was accomplished by repeatedly editing the sorted list. The sponsor column were nearly all unique.

I wanted to check whether fatality rates have changed over time, and if so, whether some groups are improving faster than others. This smoothed line chart shows the share of expeditions with fatalities by year and funding type. This is overlap with question 1.\n\n### Team Size vs Fatality\n\nNext question: does team size make a difference? You’d think larger teams might be safer due to support and redundancy, but also possibly riskier if they’re less experienced or move slowly. This scatterplot checks whether total team size correlates with success, failure, or fatalities — and whether that varies by funding type.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Code\"}\nggplot(exped_q2, aes(x = TOTMEMBERS, y = OUTCOME_LABEL, color = FUNDING_SIMPLIFIED)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, height = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"YlGnBu\", direction = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Total team members\",\n    y = \"Outcome type\",\n    title = \"Team Size and Expedition Outcome by Funding Type\",\n    subtitle = \"Each point is one expedition (2020–2024)\",\n    color = \"Funding Type\",\n    caption = \"Source: Himalayan Database via TidyTuesday (2025-01-21)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Team Size and Expedition Outcome by Funding Type](index_files/figure-html/plot-teamsize-vs-outcome-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Team Size by Funding As Proxy for Safety Resources\n\nLarge commercial teams often come with more resources: guides, oxygen, fixed ropes, medical support. That could partly explain why they have **lower fatality rates**.\n\nMeanwhile, small non-commercial teams might:\n\n-   Take harder routes (fewer sherpa or porters)\n\n-   Push limits with less redundancy\n\n-   Face more exposure if things go wrong\n\nSo while team size alone doesn’t determine safety, it’s a **proxy** for resourcing — and resourcing links back to safety.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Code\"}\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\nexped_q2 |> \n  filter(TOTMEMBERS < 50) |>  # Trim extreme outliers for better scaling\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = TOTMEMBERS,\n    y = FUNDING_SIMPLIFIED,\n    fill = FUNDING_SIMPLIFIED\n  )) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 1.2,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGnBu\", direction = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Team Size (Total Members)\",\n    y = \"Funding Type\",\n    title = \"Distribution of Team Size by Funding Type\",\n    subtitle = \"Commercial expeditions tend to bring more people\",\n    caption = \"Source: Himalayan Database via TidyTuesday (2025-01-21)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Key Findings (Q1 – Summit Success)\n\n- **Team Size**  \n  - Very small teams (1–5) & medium-large (9–20) show the highest success  \n  - Mid-sized groups (3–8) dip, and very large (>20) see slight declines  \n\n- **Peak Geography**  \n  - Mid-altitude (~7100–7300 m) hardest—technical routes, low infrastructure  \n  - High-traffic 8000 m peaks benefit from camps, fixed ropes and support  \n\n- **Temporal Trend**  \n  - Pre-COVID (2020): ~72% success  \n  - COVID slump (2021–22): ~63%  \n  - Full rebound (2023–24): ~80%  \n\n- **Commercial vs Non-Commercial**  \n  - Commercial teams recover faster post-COVID & hit ~95% success by 2024  \n  - Non-commercial plateau near ~64%\n\n---\n\n## Key Findings (Q2 – Funding & Safety)\n\n- **Funding Proxy**  \n  - **Commercial** – guided operators & adventure companies  \n  - **Non-commercial** – academic clubs, national programs, military  \n  - **Independent/Other** – private, self-organized, unknown  \n\n- **Safety Outcomes**  \n  - Commercial expeditions have **slightly lower fatality rates** (~ 5–8%) vs independent (~ 10–12%)  \n  - Accident-related terminations more common in non-commercial & independent groups  \n  - Weather-driven turn-backs uniform across all funding types  \n\n- **Fatality Trend**  \n  - All groups show modest declines in fatality rates over 2020–24  \n  - **Commercial** maintain the lowest trajectory; **Independent** show the steepest decline\n  \n## Wrap Up\n\n1. **Seasonality & route normalization** remain the strongest summit predictors.  \n2. **Resource-intensive strategies** (guided support, oxygen deployment) boost success with only **marginal safety gains** once environment is controlled.  \n3. **Mid-altitude peaks** present the greatest risk–reward paradox: technically harder but fewer logistics.  \n4. **Stakeholders** (climbers, agencies, policymakers) can use these insights to optimize team size, funding models, and risk mitigation plans.\n\n",
