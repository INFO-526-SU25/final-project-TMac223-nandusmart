Using tidy versions of the Himalayan Database, this project leverages R (tidyverse, tidy models) and Quarto to build an interactive, reproducible data-visualisation narrative around two guiding questions:\n\n-   **What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?**\n\n    -   We knit together expedition, peak, and temporal attributes to explore how season, route choice, peak height, team size, leader nationality, weather windows, and oxygen strategy correlate with summit outcomes. Visual encodings include faceted ridge plots of summit probability across seasons, interactive geographic representations of route popularity versus success.\n\n    -   A multilevel logistic model provides effect-size estimates while accounting for peak-level heterogeneity.\n\n-   **Does an expedition’s funding affect safety outcomes?**\n\n    -   Because direct cost metrics are absent, we construct a funding proxy that blends sponsorship type, total members & hired staff, oxygen usage, and expedition duration.\n\n    -   We then relate this composite to safety indicators like member and staff fatalities, high-altitude illnesses, rescue events via scatter-plot matrices, concentration curves, and Poisson regression. Stratified visualizations highlight differential risk patterns between commercial and self-organised teams.\n\nPreliminary findings suggest that\n\n\\- seasonality and route normalization remain the strongest predictors of summit success\n\n\\- larger, commercially sponsored teams enjoy slightly higher success but only marginal safety advantages once altitude and weather are controlled\n\n\\- resource intensive strategies such as extensive oxygen deployment reduce high-altitude illness yet do not eliminate fatal risk.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis project looks at data from many Himalayan mountain climbing trips. We use two main files: one has details about each expedition (called `exped_tidy.csv`), and the other has information about the mountains themselves (`peaks_tidy.csv`). The expedition data covers hundreds of trips over many years. For each trip, we know things like which mountain was climbed, how many people were in the team, if they used oxygen, if it was a commercial (guided) trip, and whether the team reached the summit or not.\n\nThe mountain (peaks) data gives us extra facts, like each mountain’s name, height, and what region it is in. By putting these two datasets together, we can explore how things like team size, the use of oxygen, type of trip, and which mountain was climbed affect the chances of reaching the summit.\n\n## Question 1: What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?\n\n-   Analyze expedition outcomes using both expedition and peak variables. \"Success\" will be defined based on the \\`TERMREASON_FACTOR\\`, with specific values representing a successful summit.\n\n-   Use factors like -- geography, team size, year, and commercial vs non-commercial expeditions\n\n### Introduction\n\nClimbing a Himalayan peak is a big challenge, and not every team that tries will reach the top. Some expeditions succeed, while others turn back before the summit. But what makes the difference? In this project, we want to understand what factors help climbers succeed and what might make them fail.\n\nWe have used following factors:\n\n|                           |\n|---------------------------|\n| Explore Team Size         |\n| Effect of Geography       |\n| Explore by Year           |\n| Explore Commercial Factor |\n\n### Approach\n\n-   Get Data from the CSV files\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Code\"}\nexped <- read_csv(\"data/exped_tidy.csv\")\npeaks <- read_csv(\"data/peaks_tidy.csv\")\n\ncolnames(peaks)\nhead(peaks)\ncolnames(exped)\nhead(exped)\n\ntable(exped$SUCCESS1, useNA = \"ifany\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Build Model & Variable Inferences\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Code\"}\ntable(exped$SUCCESS1, useNA = \"ifany\")\nexped2 <- exped |>\n  mutate(\n    success = ifelse(SUCCESS1 %in% c(\"Y\", \"Yes\", \"yes\"), 1,\n                     ifelse(SUCCESS1 %in% c(\"N\", \"No\", \"no\"), 0, as.numeric(SUCCESS1))),\n    peak = as.factor(PEAKID),\n    team_size = as.numeric(TOTMEMBERS),\n    oxygen = ifelse(O2USED %in% c(\"Y\", \"Yes\", \"yes\"), 1,\n                    ifelse(O2USED %in% c(\"N\", \"No\", \"no\"), 0, as.numeric(O2USED))),\n    season = as.factor(SEASON)\n  ) |>\n  filter(!is.na(success), !is.na(team_size), !is.na(oxygen)) \n\nmodel <- glm(\n  success ~ peak + team_size + oxygen + season + YEAR,\n  data = exped2,\n  family = \"binomial\"\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n-   Start plotting various charts building up to the case\n\n### Start\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"55%\"}\nThe Overall Success vs Failure Rate out of all expeditions.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"45%\"}\nWe will study with following variables:\n\n| Potential Factors to Study Success Rate |\n|-----------------------------------------|\n| Explore Team Size                       |\n| Effect of Geography                     |\n| Explore by Year                         |\n| Explore Commercial Factor               |\n:::\n:::::\n\n### Explore Team Size\n\n::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n:::::\n\n:::::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\" style=\"\\\"min-height:100px;\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=1800}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"25%\"}\n<!-- blank right spacer -->\n:::\n::::::\n\n### Explore Team Size Analysis\n\n::: {style=\"font-size:0.8em;

Non-commercial attempts on the same mountains are 5–10 % lower.\n\n-   **`Team-size effects differ by expedition type`**\n\n    **Commercial**: success stays high (75–100 %) across all team sizes, peaking around 20 members.\\\n    **Non-commercial**: very small groups (\\> 80 %) and very large groups (\\~75 %) do better, but mid-sized teams (5–10 climbers) dip down near 50 %\n:::\n\n## Question 2\n",
