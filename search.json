    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\nQuestion 1: What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?\nWe will analyze expedition outcomes using both expedition and peak variables. “Success” will be defined based on the TERMREASON_FACTOR, with specific values representing a successful summit (e.g., “Success (main peak)”, “Success (claimed)”).\nAs part of this attempt, we will also hypothesize that expeditions attempted during monsoon months have a significantly lower success rate similarly other factors like – geography, team size, oxygen use, and other factors relate to the likelihood of success\nWe will filter by success and explore facets of the data. Below is an example of how we might focus our attention on correlated variables.\n\n\nCode\n# Select only numeric variables\nexped_numeric &lt;- exped_tidy |&gt; select(where(is.numeric))\n\nggcorr(exped_numeric,\n  label = TRUE,\n  label_alpha = TRUE,\n  label_size = 3,\n  hjust = 1,\n  layout.exp = 1\n) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Correlation Matrix of Expedition Variables\",\n    subtitle = \"numeric variables only*\",\n    caption = \"Source: Himalayan Database (2020–2024)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables involved:\nThese are some of the variables that we think might be promising. Note that the correlation matrix above is only numeric and does not include other data types. Neither the list or the correlation plot is all inclusive.\n\nFrom exped_tidy:\nTERMREASON_FACTOR, SEASON_FACTOR, O2USED, MEMBERS, HIRDMEMB, COMRTE, YEAR\nFrom peaks_tidy:\nHEIGHTM, HIMAL_FACTOR, REGION_FACTOR, PSTATUS_FACTOR\n\n\n\nVariables to be created:\n\nSUMMIT_SUCCESS FUNDING_TYPE SUMMIT_SUCCESS will be composite variable, possibly grouped by country/team etc.\n\nThis will filter our data for further analysis.\nQuestion 2. Does an expeditions funding affect safety outcomes?\nThe analysis will be very similar for this question. I suspect there will be some overlap, funding and success rate etc. We will use many of the same variables, but more specifically, FUNDING_TYPE.\nWe will Compare specific funding types like commercial vs. independent expeditions across countries for more insights\nNOTE: Add “real world” examples of expedition success or failure to make analysis relatable."

By 2024, commercial success surged to ~95 %, while non-commercial languished around ~64%.\nAcross individual peaks, company-run trips consistently outshine independent ones\nOn major peaks (Everest, Lhotse, Ama Dablam), commercial success rates hover in the 85–95 % range. Non-commercial attempts on the same mountains are 5–10 % lower.\nTeam-size effects differ by expedition type\nCommercial: success stays high (75–100 %) across all team sizes, peaking around 20 members.\nNon-commercial: a pronounced “U-shape”, very small groups (&gt; 80 %) and very large groups (~75 %) do better, but mid-sized teams (5–10 climbers) dip down near 50 %"

We use two main files: one has details about each expedition (called exped_tidy.csv), and the other has information about the mountains themselves (peaks_tidy.csv). The expedition data covers hundreds of trips over many years. For each trip, we know things like which mountain was climbed, how many people were in the team, if they used oxygen, if it was a commercial (guided) trip, and whether the team reached the summit or not.\nThe mountain (peaks) data gives us extra facts, like each mountain’s name, height, and what region it is in. By putting these two datasets together, we can explore how things like team size, the use of oxygen, type of trip, and which mountain was climbed affect the chances of reaching the summit."

By 2024, commercial success surged to ~95 %, while non-commercial languished around ~64%.\nAcross individual peaks, company-run trips consistently outshine independent ones\nOn major peaks (Everest, Lhotse, Ama Dablam), commercial success rates hover in the 85–95 % range. Non-commercial attempts on the same mountains are 5–10 % lower.\nTeam-size effects differ by expedition type\nCommercial: success stays high (75–100 %) across all team sizes, peaking around 20 members.\nNon-commercial: very small groups (&gt; 80 %) and very large groups (~75 %) do better, but mid-sized teams (5–10 climbers) dip down near 50 %"

I wanted to check whether fatality rates have changed over time, and if so, whether some groups are improving faster than others. This smoothed line chart shows the share of expeditions with fatalities by year and funding type. This is overlap with question 1.\n\n\nTeam Size vs Fatality\nNext question: does team size make a difference? You’d think larger teams might be safer due to support and redundancy, but also possibly riskier if they’re less experienced or move slowly. This scatterplot checks whether total team size correlates with success, failure, or fatalities — and whether that varies by funding type.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(exped_q2, aes(x = TOTMEMBERS, y = OUTCOME_LABEL, color = FUNDING_SIMPLIFIED)) +\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.3, height = 0.2, alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"YlGnBu\", direction = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Total team members\",\n    y = \"Outcome type\",\n    title = \"Team Size and Expedition Outcome by Funding Type\",\n    subtitle = \"Each point is one expedition (2020–2024)\",\n    color = \"Funding Type\",\n    caption = \"Source: Himalayan Database via TidyTuesday (2025-01-21)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14)\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Size and Expedition Outcome by Funding Type\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam Size by Funding As Proxy for Safety Resources\nLarge commercial teams often come with more resources: guides, oxygen, fixed ropes, medical support. That could partly explain why they have lower fatality rates.\nMeanwhile, small non-commercial teams might:\n\nTake harder routes (fewer sherpa or porters)\nPush limits with less redundancy\nFace more exposure if things go wrong\n\nSo while team size alone doesn’t determine safety, it’s a proxy for resourcing — and resourcing links back to safety.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\nexped_q2 |&gt; \n  filter(TOTMEMBERS &lt; 50) |&gt;  # Trim extreme outliers for better scaling\n  ggplot(aes(\n    x = TOTMEMBERS,\n    y = FUNDING_SIMPLIFIED,\n    fill = FUNDING_SIMPLIFIED\n  )) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 1.2,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"YlGnBu\", direction = 1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Team Size (Total Members)\",\n    y = \"Funding Type\",\n    title = \"Distribution of Team Size by Funding Type\",\n    subtitle = \"Commercial expeditions tend to bring more people\",\n    caption = \"Source: Himalayan Database via TidyTuesday (2025-01-21)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")"

This was accomplished by repeatedly editing the sorted list. The sponsor column were nearly all unique. I found an example here:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59082243/multiple-patterns-for-string-matching-using-case-when"

This smoothed line chart shows the share of expeditions with fatalities by year and funding type. This is overlap with question 1."

You’d think larger teams might be safer due to support and redundancy, but also possibly riskier if they’re less experienced or move slowly.
