    "text": "Analysis plan\n\nA plan for answering each of the questions including the variables involved, variables to be created (if any), external data to be merged in (if any).\n\nQuestion 1: What factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?\nWe will analyze expedition outcomes using both expedition and peak variables. “Success” will be defined based on the TERMREASON_FACTOR, with specific values representing a successful summit (e.g., “Success (main peak)”, “Success (claimed)”). The aim is to model how geography, team size, oxygen use, and other factors relate to the likelihood of success.\nWe will filter by success and explore facets of the data. Below is an example of how we might focus our attention on correlated variables.\n\n\nCode\n# Select only numeric variables\nexped_numeric &lt;- exped_tidy |&gt; select(where(is.numeric))\n\nggcorr(exped_numeric,\n  label = TRUE,\n  label_alpha = TRUE,\n  label_size = 3,\n  hjust = 1,\n  layout.exp = 1\n) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1, size = 8),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.caption = element_text(size = 10)\n  ) +\n  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Correlation Matrix of Expedition Variables\",\n    subtitle = \"numeric variables only*\",\n    caption = \"Source: Himalayan Database (2020–2024)\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables involved:\nThese are some of the variables that we think might be promising. Note that the correlation matrix above is only numeric and does not include other data types. Neither the list or the correlation plot is all inclusive.\n\nFrom exped_tidy:\nTERMREASON_FACTOR, SEASON_FACTOR, O2USED, MEMBERS, HIRDMEMB, COMRTE, YEAR\nFrom peaks_tidy:\nHEIGHTM, HIMAL_FACTOR, REGION_FACTOR, PSTATUS_FACTOR\n\n\n\nVariables to be created:\n\nSUMMIT_SUCCESS FUNDING_TYPE SUMMIT_SUCCESS will be composite variable, possibly grouped by country/team etc.\n\nThis will filter our data for further analysis.\nQuestion 2. Does an expeditions funding affect safety outcomes?\nThe analysis will be very similar for this question. I suspect there will be some overlap, funding and success rate etc. We will use many of the same variables, but more specifically, FUNDING_TYPE.\nNOTE: Add “real world” examples of expedition success or failure to make analysis relatable."

Using tidy versions of the Himalayan Database, this project leverages R (tidyverse, tidy models) and Quarto to build an interactive, reproducible data-visualisation narrative around two guiding questions:\n\nWhat factors contribute to the success or failure of a summit?\n\nWe knit together expedition, peak, and temporal attributes to explore how season, route choice, peak height, team size, leader nationality, weather windows, and oxygen strategy correlate with summit outcomes. Visual encodings include faceted ridge plots of summit probability across seasons, interactive geographic representations of route popularity versus success.\nA multilevel logistic model provides effect-size estimates while accounting for peak-level heterogeneity.\n\nDoes an expedition’s funding affect safety outcomes?\n\nBecause direct cost metrics are absent, we construct a funding proxy that blends sponsorship type, total members & hired staff, oxygen usage, and expedition duration.\nWe then relate this composite to safety indicators like member and staff fatalities, high-altitude illnesses, rescue events via scatter-plot matrices, concentration curves, and Poisson regression. Stratified visualizations highlight differential risk patterns between commercial and self-organised teams.\n\n\nPreliminary findings suggest that\n- seasonality and route normalization remain the strongest predictors of summit success\n- larger, commercially sponsored teams enjoy slightly higher success but only marginal safety advantages once altitude and weather are controlled\n- resource intensive strategies such as extensive oxygen deployment reduce high-altitude illness yet do not eliminate fatal risk."
